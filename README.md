### Airbnb Analysis

### Situation

The goal of the project was to perform an analysis of the Airbnb dataset and provide details about Airbnb in the New York area.

### Task

My mission for this project is to build a dashboard in Tableau where I can showcase the Airbnb details of the New York Area so that it would be helpful for people who are looking for Airbnb in New York. 

### Action

- Depending on the user's selection of Neighbourhood groups and the specific neighborhood they want to stay in, I build a dashboard that would help the people in finding:
  1. No.of Airbnbs
  2. Room Types ( Entire Room / Private Room / Shared Room ) in that area
  3. Specific Room Types Details ( Avg Minimum Nights, Avg Price, and Number of Reviews )
- I have also developed an innovative Airbnb map functionality that enhances user experience by allowing them to effortlessly search for accommodations in specific neighborhood groups or neighborhoods.

Below is the dashboard that I have created:

### Result

From the analysis, the following meaningful insights were observed.
- In the New York area, there are a total of 48,895 Airbnbs.
- For room types people in New York Entire home and a Private room are available more than a Shared room.
- The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview based on the user's selection of either the Neighbourhood Group or the specific Neighbourhood. It displays the number of available Airbnb listings in the chosen area, giving users a clear understanding of the accommodation options. 
  Furthermore, the dashboard highlights the predominant types of rooms available in the desired neighborhood, allowing users to identify the most common options.
- The dashboard also includes detailed information on each room type, including pricing details and the number of reviews. This would enable the users to make informed decisions based on their budget and preferences. This would help the user to find a perfect accommodation that would meet 
  their needs.
